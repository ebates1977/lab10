Mental Health 

Mental health combines our emotional, psychological, and social wellbeing; Affecting how we think, act, and feel on the day-to-day basis. Mental health and physical health are equally important pieces of our wellbeing. The presence or absence of a mental illness is not a predictor of mental health; someone without a mental illness could have poor mental health, just as a person with a mental illness could have excellent mental health. Mental illnesses are among the most common illnesses in the U.S.A., as 50% of Americans will be diagnosed with a mental illness or disorder in their lifetime, and 1 in 25 Americans live with a serious disorder - schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression (About mental health, CDC). Mental illnesses affect people of ages, income, races, and education levels; However, systematic biases - such as racism, homophobia, poverty, and gender-based violence - can worsen mental health, if support is not easily accessible (Fast facts about mental health and mental illness). Eating disorders affect approximately 1 million Canadians – between 0.3-1% of the population. They impact women at a rate ten times that of men and have the highest rate of mortality of any mental illness. The mortality rate due to suicide among men is three times the rate among women, but girls and young women are three times more likely than men to harm themselves and be hospitalized from self-harm. In 2019, 4,012 Canadians died by suicide. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth and young adults between 15-34 years. In Canada, suicide disproportionately impacts Indigenous peoples; the rate of suicide among First Nations is three times higher than among non-Indigenous Canadians, and nine times higher among Inuit (Fast facts about mental health and mental illness).  

 

History of Mental Health 

Historically, mental disorders have had three major explanations, namely, the supernatural, biological, and psychological models. When people encountered inexplicable, irrational behaviors, they were thought to be evil, and needed cleansing. In the Persian Empire - between the years 550 and 330 B.C.- all mentally and physically injured patients were considered to be evil or possessed by the devil. Mental illnesses were widely recognized in ancient Mesopotamia. Since hands were believed to have control over a person, mental disorders were known to be “hands” of deities. One psychological illness was known as Qāt Ištar, meaning "Hand of Ishtar". However, descriptions of these illnesses has made it nearly impossible for modern doctors to identify said illness. Mesopotamian doctors took highly detailed notes on their patients’ hallucinations, then assigned different spiritual meanings to them. Seeing a dog, meant you would die; Seeing a gazelle meant you would survive. The royal family of Elam was infamous for its members often suffering from insanity. An ancient Egyptian document known as the Ebers Papyrus is an Egyptian archive holding all medical knowledge - 700 magical formulas and folk remedies meant to cure illnesses. The Ebers Papyrus contained descriptions of the damaged state of mind, The loss of concentration, the inability to pay attention, and emotional distress in the heart or mind. The descriptions were translated into modern medicine, being renamed as hysteria and melancholy. Ancient Hindu documents - Ramayana and Mahabharata - had fabricated portrayals of depression and anxiety. Mental disorders were generally thought to depict metaphysical entities, the supernatural, and sorcery or witchcraft. The ancient Chinese believed that mental disorders were thought to be demonic possession, treated mainly under Traditional Chinese Medicine using herbs, acupuncture or emotional therapy. In ancient Greece and Rome, madness was thought to be aimless wandering and violence. Hippocrates classified mental disorders, including paranoia, epilepsy, mania, and melancholia. Hippocrates acknowledges the practice of bloodletting in the fifth century, he believed that existence was represented by the four basic elements—earth, air, fire, and water—which in humans were related to the four basic humors: blood, phlegm, black bile, yellow bile. Hippocrates’ diagnosis of syphilis was a vital component to the idea that mental disorders were caused by biological factors. His diagnosis was also the precursor to modern psycho-social treatments. Well known philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, etc., wrote about the significance of fantasies, dreams, and therefore anticipated, to some extent, the fields of psychoanalytic study and cognitive knowledge that were then developed.

Poor Mental Health and the Causes	 

Mental illnesses are caused by a complex combination of genetic, biological, personality and environmental factors. Trauma during your childhood or adulthood, can create mental illnesses if supports for recovery are not available or sought out. Environmental factors can play a significant role in creating mental disorders, such as the inability to access safe and affordable housing, meaningful education and employment, leisure activities, the support of a community, access to land and nature, freedom from violence, and good access to health care and mental health services (Fast facts about mental health and mental illness). Some research suggests that mental health problems may be linked to a variation in certain brain chemicals - such as serotonin and dopamine - but no one really understands how or why. Arguments that someone's brain chemistry is the cause of mental health problems are very weak (What causes mental health problems?). Mental illness is more apparent in people whose blood relatives share a mental illness. Certain genes may increase your risk of developing a mental illness, and your life situation may trigger it. Exposure to stressors while in the womb - toxins, alcohol, or drugs - can occasionally be linked to mental disorders (Mental illness). 

 

Treatments  

Many people suffering from mental illnesses retrieve strength or recover by using individual or group treatments. There is no set treatment that works for everyone, individuals must choose the one that works the best for them. There are four main treatments for mental illnesses. The first, most widely used treatment is psychotherapy. Psychotherapy is the treatment of mental disorders through therapy, offered by a trained professional. Psychotherapy explores thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and seeks to improve an individual’s well-being. Psychotherapy paired with medication is the most effective way to promote recovery. Examples include Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Exposure Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, etc. (Mental health treatments). Medication for mental disorders - such as depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder (BPD), or schizophrenia - are commonly used. Common medications for depression include Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), such as citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine HRI (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft). Another treatment, less commonly used, is hospitalization for the disorder. In few cases, hospitalization may be necessary to prevent the individual from harming themselves or others. Sometimes a support group is an option where members guide each other towards the shared goal of recovery. Support groups are often comprised of nonprofessionals, but peers that have suffered from similar experiences (Mental health treatments). 

 

Awareness Campaigns 

Many companies and organizations have mental health awareness campaigns, as an attempt to destigmatize having a mental disorder. A very well-known campaign is the ‘Bell Let’s Talk’ campaign; Founded in 2010, the campaign has committed over $121 million to mental health in Canada with over 1.3 billion interactions registered across various forms of media. The Bell Let’s Talk campaign was supposed to be a five-year, $50 million project to create a stigma free country and drive action in mental health care; In 2015, the campaign was renewed for another five years, with a target of committing $100 million. Again, in 2020, Bell Let’s Talk was renewed for another five years, with a goal of $155 million. The most important piece of this campaign is the annual, one day, “Bell Let’s Talk” day, where money is donated to mental health funds based on the number of social media and communication that include the branded hashtag “#BellLetsTalk”. The campaign has become so successful that #BellLetsTalk became the number 1 trending topic on Twitter in 2015, and in 2018, the respective #BellLetsTalk hashtag was the most used Canadian hashtag - of 2018 - on Twitter (Bell let's talk).
